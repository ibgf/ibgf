## About IBGF

The International Board Games Federation (IBGF), officially known in French as *Fédération Internationale des Jeux de Société (FIJS)*, is a non-profit international association governed by the French law of 1 July 1901.

Headquartered in Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, the IBGF brings together board game enthusiasts, organizations, researchers, and event organizers from all over the world to promote board game culture and education.

Our members come from diverse backgrounds: game designers, board game café owners, festival organizers, and passionate players. Of course, we also warmly welcome beginners — everyone grows through playing together.

Our activities include:
- Organizing international board game festivals and fairs
- Supporting game design competitions
- Promoting academic research on board games
- Encouraging healthy, screen-free social interaction
